## Method

DreamerV2 is the first world model agent that achieves human-level performance
on the Atari benchmark. DreamerV2 also outperforms the final performance of the
top model-free agents Rainbow and IQN using the same amount of experience and
computation. The implementation in this repository alternates between training
the world model, training the policy, and collecting experience and runs on a
single GPU.

DreamerV2 learns a model of the environment directly from high-dimensional
input images. For this, it predicts ahead using compact learned states. The
states consist of a deterministic part and several categorical variables that
are sampled. The prior for these categoricals is learned through a KL loss. The
world model is learned end-to-end via straight-through gradients, meaning that
the gradient of the density is set to the gradient of the sample.

![Actor Critic Learning](https://imgur.com/wH9kJ2O.png)

DreamerV2 learns actor and critic networks from imagined trajectories of latent
states. The trajectories start at encoded states of previously encountered
sequences. The world model then predicts ahead using the selected actions and
its learned state prior. The critic is trained using temporal difference
learning and the actor is trained to maximize the value function via reinforce
and straight-through gradients.

## Instructions

Get dependencies:

```sh
apt install -y \
    python3 python3-pip curl unrar unzip ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6
pip3 install --no-cache --upgrade pip setuptool
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
curl -L http://www.atarimania.com/roms/Roms.rar > ./Roms.rar
unzip ROMS.zip
unrar x Roms.rar
python3 -m atari_py.import_roms ./ROMS
rm ROMS.zip
rm Roms.rar
rm -r ./ROMS
```

Train the agent:

```sh
python3 dreamerv2/train.py --logdir ~/logdir/atari_pong/dreamerv2/1 --configs defaults atari --task atari_pong
```

Monitor results:

```sh
tensorboard --logdir ~/logdir
```

Generate plots:

```sh
python3 common/plot.py --indir ~/logdir --outdir ~/plots --xaxis step --yaxis eval_return --bins 1e6
```

Tips:

- **Efficient debugging.** You can use the `debug` config as in `--configs
defaults atari debug`. This reduces the batch size, increases the evaluation
frequency, and disables `tf.function` graph compilation for easy line-by-line
debugging.

- **Infinite gradient norms.** This is normal and described under loss scaling in
the [mixed precision][mixed] guide. You can disable mixed precision by passing
`--precision 32` to the training script. Mixed precision is faster but can in
principle cause numerical instabilities.

- **Accessing logged metrics.** The metrics are stored in both TensorBoard and
JSON lines format. You can directly load them using `pandas.read_json()`. The
plotting script also stores the binned and aggregated metrics of multiple runs
into a single JSON file for easy manual plotting.
